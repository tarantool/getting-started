### Start exploring the Tarantool platform!

The Tarantool demo cluster is available to you. On it you can get acquainted with the basic capabilities of the platform.

Training can be completed in 15 minutes. Go through it and then you will be able to:

* configure the cluster
* set data schema
* raise HTTP API for clients
* implement read / write requests
* scale the cluster

The cluster is accessible from the outside. You can connect to it using the `tarantoolctl` utility and perform any operations.
Connection details can be found in the "Cluster" tab.

If something goes wrong, you can do a reset. The reset button is also located under the "Cluster" tab. The demo cluster will also automatically reset after 24 hours of inactivity.
